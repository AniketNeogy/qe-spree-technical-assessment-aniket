# Spree Commerce - Automation Test Coverage Strategy

## Overview

This test coverage strategy outlines the key functional areas of the Spree Commerce platform to be automated, prioritizes test scenarios based on risk assessment, and identifies high-priority candidates for implementation in the Playwright framework.

## Key Functional Areas

The test scenarios cover these core functional areas of the Spree Commerce platform:

1. **End-to-End User Flows**: Complete purchase flows, user registration, abandoned cart recovery, and critical user paths.
2. **Product Discovery**: Browsing, searching, and filtering product catalog.
3. **Shopping Cart Operations**: Adding, updating, and removing products.
4. **Checkout Process**: Guest and registered user checkout flows.
5. **Payment Processing**: Credit card payments, alternative methods, and error handling.
6. **Account Management**: Profile updates, order history, and address management.
7. **Admin Operations**: Order processing and product management.
8. **Security and Performance**: Transaction security, data handling, and performance benchmarks.

## Risk Assessment

The risk assessment considers multiple factors to prioritize automation efforts:

### High Risk Areas

* **Purchase Completion**: Direct impact on revenue generation and customer satisfaction.
* **Payment Processing**: Potential for financial loss, fraud, or abandoned transactions.
* **User Authentication**: Security vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access.
* **Cart Functionality**: Core elements that enable the purchase process.

### Medium Risk Areas

* **Account Management**: Issues affecting registered users but not preventing purchases.
* **Admin Operations**: Problems impacting business operations but limited to staff.
* **Order History**: Post-purchase experience issues.

### Lower Risk Areas

* **Informational Content**: Static content with lower business impact.
* **Secondary Features**: Functions not essential to the primary purchase flow.
* **UI Cosmetic Elements**: Visual elements that don't impair functionality.

## Test Prioritization

Based on the risk assessment, test scenarios are prioritized as follows:

### High Priority

1. **E2E-01: User Registration and Purchase (New User)** ✅
   * Essential customer acquisition pathway
   * Combines account creation, authentication and purchase flows
   * Validates data persistence for registered users

2. **E2E-02: Complete Purchase Flow (Guest User)** ✅
   * Critical revenue path that must function flawlessly
   * Tests guest user is able to checkout successfully

3. **E2E-03: Abandoned Cart Recovery** ✅
   * Significant revenue recovery opportunity
   * Tests session persistence and state management

4. **E2E-04: Payment Processing Validation (API-based)** ✅
   * Direct financial impact
   * Security and compliance implications
   * Tests API endpoints for payment processing
   * Validates API response structure and error handling
   * Implemented with a robust API client featuring fallback mechanisms

5. **AM-01: Profile and Preferences Management**
   * Customer retention and data integrity

### Medium Priority

1. **E2E-05: Product Discovery and Filtering**
   * Product discoverability affects conversion
   * Complex UI interactions

2. **AM-02: Order History and Tracking**
   * Post-purchase satisfaction
   * Order management verification

3. **AD-01: Order Processing and Management**
   * Operational efficiency
   * Business process integrity

### Lower Priority

1. **AD-02: Inventory and Product Management**
   * Admin-only functionality
   * Indirect impact on customer experience

2. **SP-01: Secure Transactions and Data Handling**
   * Important but can be partially covered by security audits
   * Some aspects require specialized testing approaches

3. **SP-02: Page Load Performance**
   * Impacts user experience and conversion rates
   * Can be automated with Playwright's performance metrics API
   * Should be monitored over time for regression

## Primary Automation Candidates

The following scenarios have been implemented in Playwright:

1. **E2E-01: User Registration and Purchase (New User)** ✅
   * **Implementation Status**: Completed
   * **Key Features**: Sequential flow with account creation, authentication validation, and purchase completion

2. **E2E-02: Complete Purchase Flow (Guest User)** ✅
   * **Implementation Status**: Completed
   * **Key Features**: End-to-end test with guest user purchase flow

3. **E2E-03: Abandoned Cart Recovery** ✅
   * **Implementation Status**: Completed
   * **Key Features**: Multi-session test with browser context management

4. **E2E-04: Payment Processing Validation (API-based)** ✅
   * **Implementation Status**: Completed
   * **Key Features**: 
     * Direct API client implementation
     * Handles multiple payment methods (credit card, check)
     * Validates successful and failed payment scenarios
     * Includes mock mode for reliable testing
     * Intelligent error handling with useful diagnostics
     * API validation of order status after payment

**Note**: The reason `AM-01` is not picked is because the number of occurrences of the user flows related to other use cases will be much higher than `AM-01`. 
Hence considering the regression benefits, `E2E-01` to `E2E-04` were picked up for automation.
