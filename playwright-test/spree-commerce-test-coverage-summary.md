# Spree Commerce - Automation Test Coverage Strategy

## Overview

This test coverage strategy outlines the key functional areas of the Spree Commerce platform to be automated, prioritizes test scenarios based on risk assessment, and identifies high-priority candidates for implementation in the Playwright framework.

## Key Functional Areas

The test scenarios cover these core functional areas of the Spree Commerce platform:

1. **End-to-End User Flows**: Complete purchase flows, user registration, abandoned cart recovery, and critical user paths.
2. **Product Discovery**: Browsing, searching, and filtering product catalog.
3. **Shopping Cart Operations**: Adding, updating, and removing products.
4. **Checkout Process**: Guest and registered user checkout flows.
5. **Payment Processing**: Credit card payments, alternative methods, and error handling.
6. **Account Management**: Profile updates, order history, and address management.
7. **Admin Operations**: Order processing and product management.
8. **Security and Performance**: Transaction security, data handling, and performance benchmarks.

## Risk Assessment

The risk assessment considers multiple factors to prioritize automation efforts:

### High Risk Areas

* **Purchase Completion**: Direct impact on revenue generation and customer satisfaction.
* **Payment Processing**: Potential for financial loss, fraud, or abandoned transactions.
* **User Authentication**: Security vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access.
* **Cart Functionality**: Core elements that enable the purchase process.

### Medium Risk Areas

* **Account Management**: Issues affecting registered users but not preventing purchases.
* **Admin Operations**: Problems impacting business operations but limited to staff.
* **Order History**: Post-purchase experience issues.

### Lower Risk Areas

* **Informational Content**: Static content with lower business impact.
* **Secondary Features**: Functions not essential to the primary purchase flow.
* **UI Cosmetic Elements**: Visual elements that don't impair functionality.

## Test Prioritization

Based on the risk assessment, test scenarios are prioritized as follows:

### High Priority

1. **E2E-01: Complete Purchase Flow (Guest User)**
   * Critical revenue path that must function flawlessly
   * Covers multiple integrated components in a single flow

2. **E2E-02: User Registration and Purchase**
   * Essential customer acquisition pathway
   * Combines authentication and purchase flows

3. **E2E-03: Abandoned Cart Recovery**
   * Significant revenue recovery opportunity
   * Tests session persistence and state management

4. **E2E-04: Payment Processing Validation**
   * Direct financial impact
   * Security and compliance implications

5. **AM-01: Profile and Preferences Management**
   * Customer retention and data integrity

### Medium Priority

1. **E2E-05: Product Discovery and Filtering**
   * Product discoverability affects conversion
   * Complex UI interactions

2. **AM-02: Order History and Tracking**
   * Post-purchase satisfaction
   * Order management verification

3. **AD-01: Order Processing and Management**
   * Operational efficiency
   * Business process integrity

### Lower Priority

1. **AD-02: Inventory and Product Management**
   * Admin-only functionality
   * Indirect impact on customer experience

2. **SP-01: Secure Transactions and Data Handling**
   * Important but can be partially covered by security audits
   * Some aspects require specialized testing approaches

3. **SP-02: Page Load Performance**
   * Impacts user experience and conversion rates
   * Can be automated with Playwright's performance metrics API
   * Should be monitored over time for regression

## Automation Implementation Strategy

### Core Framework Components

The Playwright automation framework will include:

1. **Page Object Models**: Encapsulated UI components for maintainability
2. **Data Helpers**: Test data generation and management
3. **API Utilities**: Direct API calls for test setup and verification
4. **State Handling**: Session and authentication management

### Test Data Approach

1. **Dynamic Test Data**: Generate unique test data for each run
2. **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Reset application state between tests
3. **Mock Services**: Simulate external dependencies where needed

### Primary Automation Candidates

The following scenarios are recommended for immediate implementation in Playwright:

1. **E2E-01: Complete Purchase Flow (Guest User)**
   * **Implementation Priority**: Highest
   * **Rationale**: Validates the core revenue path
   * **Technical Approach**: Full end-to-end test with real UI interaction

2. **E2E-03: Abandoned Cart Recovery**
   * **Implementation Priority**: High
   * **Rationale**: Tests critical state persistence functionality
   * **Technical Approach**: Multi-session test with browser context management

3. **E2E-04: Payment Processing Validation**
   * **Implementation Priority**: High
   * **Rationale**: Ensures payment processing integrity
   * **Technical Approach**: Combined UI flows with API verification, payment mocking

4. **E2E-02: User Registration and Purchase**
   * **Implementation Priority**: High
   * **Rationale**: Validates new user onboarding and purchasing
   * **Technical Approach**: Sequential flow with authentication validation

5. **AM-01: Profile and Preferences Management**
   * **Implementation Priority**: Medium
   * **Rationale**: Ensures data persistence and account functionality
   * **Technical Approach**: Form interaction tests with database verification

## API Testing Strategy

For critical operations, especially payment processing, a hybrid approach is recommended:

1. **UI-Driven Flows**: For user-visible functionality
2. **API Authentication**: For efficient session management
3. **API Verification**: For backend state validation
4. **Mock Responses**: For simulating payment provider responses

## Conclusion

This automation strategy focuses on risk-based test selection to maximize coverage of critical business functions. The prioritized test scenarios represent the core user interactions with the highest impact on business success.

By implementing these automation tests with Playwright, we can:

1. Establish continuous validation of critical e-commerce paths
2. Provide rapid feedback on key functionality
3. Build a foundation for expanding test coverage
4. Support confident releases with automated regression testing
